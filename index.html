          You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

              to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I
              went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I
              even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100%
              web solution.

              They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
              developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it.
              And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
